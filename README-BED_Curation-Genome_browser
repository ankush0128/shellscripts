ERROR: 
Error File **'NAMEofthebedfile.bed' - Error line 2 of custom track: thickStart out of range (chromStart to chromEnd, or 0 if no CDS)"**

The error is resulted for because of standard .bed+6 format ( UCSC reads the file as if there is no header). 

Column 7 in bed file is:thickStart - The starting position at which the feature is drawn thickly (for example, the start codon in gene displays). 

When there is no thick part, thickStart and thickEnd are usually set to the chromStart position.
Where as, official UCSC broad/narrowPeak format (http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format12), column 7 is:
**signalValue** - Measurement of overall (usually, average) enrichment for the region.

This breaks because with no header line to define the file as broad or narrowPeak format, they are read as standard .bed+6 files. 

Adding a proper header line will fix this error
